					    <ul>
						<li>Fixed a issue with the "Genre" tag</li>
						<li>Fixed the handling of 64 bit files, sometimes Subler would create a 32bit file even if the "64 bit data" checkbox was enabled</li>
						<li>Prepopulate the Save panel of a new file with a default filename based on the filename of the first track added to the file.</li>
						<li>Read/write H.264 profile/level on video tracks. It's possible to change the H.264 profile/level to trick iTunes into syncing files to iPhone/iPad. Resolves issue #139.</li>
						<li>Improved TagChimp search, especially for TV Shows.
