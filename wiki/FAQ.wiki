#Frequently Asked Question.

*Why doesn't QuickTime and others Apple's devices see the subtitles/chapters?*

The file extension must be .m4v, or QuickTime and iPod/AppleTV won't show any subtitles tracks.


*Why does my SRT file not import in Subler?*

Even though the text encoding detector should detect the text encoding of your SRT file, it sometimes fails to do so. You'll increase your chances of success by using UTF-8 encoding. You can use Jubler to edit the SRT file before importing in Subler.


*Why doesn't QuickTime Player X shows my subtitles ?*

QuickTime X has some known issues with subtitles lines that contains multiple styles. If you want to be compatible with QuickTime X you should remove all the style tags (i.e. <i></i>) from your srt file.

*What's the "Optimize" function ?*

It interleaves the audio and video samples, and puts the "MooV" atom at the begining of the file, restoring the Quicktime "fast-start" (also known as "pseudo-streaming") ability of the file.
