#Frequently Asked Question.

*Why doesn't QuickTime and others Apple's devices see the subtitles/chapters?*

The file extension must be .m4v, or QuickTime and iPod/AppleTV won't show any subtitles tracks.


*Why does my SRT file not import in Subler?*

Check that it's proper UTF-8 text encoding. You can use Jubler to edit the SRT file before importing in Subler.
