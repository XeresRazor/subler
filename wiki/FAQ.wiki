#Frequently Asked Question.

*Why doesn't QuickTime and others Apple's devices see the subtitles/chapters?*

The file extension must be .m4v, or QuickTime and iPod/AppleTV won't show any subtitles tracks.

*How can I add chapters' images?*

Enable the "Create Preview Images" checkbox in the Preferences, the next time you will save or optimize a file, a new track with the chapters' images will be created.

*Why does my SRT file not import in Subler?*

Even though the text encoding detector should detect the text encoding of your SRT file, it sometimes fails to do so. You'll increase your chances of success by using UTF-8 encoding. You can use Jubler to edit the SRT file before importing in Subler.


*Why doesn't QuickTime Player X shows my subtitles ?*

Fixed in Mac OS X 10.6.3.
(QuickTime X has some known issues with subtitles lines that contains multiple styles. If you want to be compatible with QuickTime X you should remove all the style tags (i.e. <i></i>) from your srt file.)

*What's the "Optimize" function ?*

It interleaves the audio and video samples, and puts the "MooV" atom at the begining of the file, restoring the Quicktime "fast-start" (also known as "pseudo-streaming") ability of the file.

*Why can't I mux file larger than 4GB?*

You need to enable the "64 Bit chunk offset" checkbox if you think the files will be bigger than 4GB. It's not enabled by default, because many devices (old iPod, Playstation 3) can't read this type of mp4.
