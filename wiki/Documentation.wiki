==Introduction==

===What is Subler?===

Subler is a Mac OS X application that opens media containers, allows you to add or remove data inside them, and then saves them out again. In the specialized language of the video world, Subler is a "transcoder", a transcoder dedicated to creating MPEG4 files (.m4v, .mp4) for iDevices.

Subler original purpose was to allow you to easily add subtitles to your video files, and thus the name "subler". In time, new features have been added to help Subler solve similar common problems. For instance, with Subler you can open an existing media file, add chapter titles, remove an unwanted commentary track, tag the file, and then save it back out again.

Subler can do all of these tasks that would normally need separate programs, and often finish all of these tasks faster than any one of these utilities.

===What is a "media container"?===

In the past, different types of computer data would be stored in a file that contained only that data. For instance, .doc files were Microsoft Word documents, and .txt were text files. Some of these files had the ability to include other types of data, a picture inside a Word document for instance. But since programs did one thing, and the formats they used were tightly bound to the programs, file formats and programs were largely one and the same.

This wasn't true for multimedia. Multimedia files are highly variable and might contain any sort of data. One might have a video track and audio, a typical movie. Another might add several audio tracks to support different languages. Subtitles, producer commentary, all of these might appear or not appear and change from file to file.

To support this sort of flexibility, multimedia systems like QuickTime try to separate the file from the media inside, and refer to the file itself as nothing more than a "container". In theory, you shouldn't think of an .mp4 file as a "movie", as it might contain nothing more than a song. But in the real world, different containers quickly became associated with specific media types inside. The video inside a QuickTime file wouldn't work on a PC without installing QuickTime.

But this isn't as true as it was. With the introduction of the H.264 video format, the entire media world has quickly been moving to MP4 media. That means that the video inside that QuickTime file is the same as the video inside an AVI. Audio too is likely to work across platforms. In theory, QuickTime should be the major container format and everyone should be able to read it, as it was accepted as part of the wider MP4 standard. In spite of this, or perhaps because of it, different container formats continue to proliferate. Other major container formats are .avi from the Wintel world, and .mkv, an open-standard developed under the Matroska project.

===What is "transcoding"?===

Media container files all have the same basic purpose, and generally have the same set of features. All of them have their own advantages and problems. Honestly, there's little technical reason, these days, to pick one format over the other. This is especially true if you consider the media inside the container. Most movies contain a video track, one or more audio tracks, and sometimes a text track for subtitles.

In the past it was unlikely that the formats of the media inside could play on other platforms -- an .avi file from the Wintel world would normally include video that Apple's QuickTime understood. But more recently, the H.264 format has rapidly started taking over the video side of things, and AC-3 is common for sound. So, when you open this variety of containers, you often find the media within would work just fine on your iDevice, if only the container was the right one.

"Transcoding" is the task of changing the container format, taking the media from one container format and then placing it, unchanged, into another container. Thats what Subler does; it takes media out of practically any recent container file, and moves it into a working QuickTime file. If the media inside can be played by your iDevice, and this is increasingly common, Subler can convert the file for you in seconds.

'''What's the difference between Subler and Handbrake?'''

Subler is a transcoder, it takes the media inside a container, adds or removes tracks and makes similar minor changes, and saves out the media in another container. This process is very fast -- transcoding a 1-hour movie takes maybe two to three minutes.

Handbrake is a converter, or "recoder". It takes the media inside the container, converts it into a new format, and saves it to another container. Converting a movie requires every frame of the video to be decoded and recoded into a new format, which can take hours.

Subler only "works" if the media formats inside the container are something your media device can play. Handbrake can ''change'' that media into something your media device can play. So why would you use Subler at all? Because it's extremely fast. So when the formats are compatible and the stars align, Subler is the way to go. It's so fast, you should just try it to see what happens, and then move on to Handbrake if that doesn't work.

===What containers does Subler read?===

Subler is based on an open-source library called ffmpeg. ffmpeg is constantly updated to support new formats. A fairly recent list of these can be found on the Wikipedia article on the topic, here:

===What else does it do?===

Subler was not originally a transcoder, it was originally a way for opening up media files for editing subtitle tracks. This functionality is still there, improved, expanded, and is used in some form with just about every file.

Subler supports the SubRip style subtitle tracks, in .srt files. SubRip is a text file containing the subtitle text with some basic mark-up to add style and properly synch it with the video. Subler can add multiple caption files to support multiple languages, and has a few switches you can use to move the titles around or delay them to account for additional material added to the start of the file (ads). Here's an outline of the basic format:

Subler also allows you to edit the "metadata" in the file, things like the title, season and episode numbers, description and ratings. These show up in your players, like the AppleTV or iTunes, and help you organize your media. Most rippers and recorders don't bother to add this data, which means you have to do it by hand. Subler supports a long list of tags, and lets you import them from a text file. Better yet, Subler also has links to popular "metadata" databases to automate this process, finding the data on tagChimp database and adding it all in a few clicks.

Subler also lets you edit the "chapter" information that you find in most iTunes movies. These can be imported from a text file to make them easy to add in bulk. Subler will also create chapter images that QuickTime uses to quickly move through the files.

Finally, Subler can correct for basic errors made by most encoders, allowing the file to be more easily understood and played by QuickTime based players.
