#summary Various ways to use Subler

==Overview==

Subler is based around the idea of "projects". In the Subler, projects are represented by windows with a track listing at the top, and data from the tracks below. After creating a new project, you associate it with media tracks by Open…ing files from the File menu, or simply dragging and dropping them from the Finder into the project window. As each file is added, you will be asked which tracks you would like to read out of the file, adding them to the track list.

For instance, lets say you have a movie in an .mkv file, and a text file with subtitles for the movie in an .srt file. To make a new file with the movie and the subtitles, you would create a new project, drag the movie file into the project window, then drag the subtitle file into the project, then save. Presto! It's that easy!
